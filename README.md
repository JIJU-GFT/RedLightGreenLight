# Run the app locally

## Downloading the repo
Clone the repo using <code>git clone https://github.com/JIJU-GFT/RedLightGreenLight.git</code>.

##Â Installing dependencies
Once the repo is downloaded, head to the root of the project and run <code>npm run install</code> to install the libraries and dependencies. This might take a while.

## Running the project
1. When you have all the dependencies installed (you should see a new <code>node_modules</code> folder in the root folder), just run <code>npm run start</code> to serve the project locally.
2. It should automatically open in your preferred browser. If not, check your terminal for a link similar to <code>http://localhost:[port]/RedLightGreenLight</code>.
